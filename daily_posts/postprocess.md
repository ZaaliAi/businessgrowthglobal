# Daily Post Generation Process

This document outlines the process used to generate the daily LinkedIn post.

## 1. Research & Analysis

The process begins by researching the latest articles and insights from a curated list of top-tier business publications. The goal is to identify emerging trends, actionable strategies, and thought-provoking ideas that are relevant to a senior business audience.

**Research Sources:**
- The Hustle: [https://thehustle.co/](https://thehustle.co/) (Note: This source failed to load during this run)
- Strategy+Business: [https://www.strategy-business.com/](https://www.strategy-business.com/)
- Harvard Business Review: [https://hbr.org/](https://hbr.org/)

The content from these sources is synthesized to identify 2-3 core themes that are then developed into the main points of the LinkedIn post.

## 2. Content Creation

Once the core themes are identified, the post is drafted with the following principles in mind:
- **Structure:** The post is formatted for maximum readability on LinkedIn, using a strong headline, short paragraphs, whitespace, and relevant hashtags.
- **Tone:** The voice is professional, insightful, and human-centric, avoiding AI-generated jargon, unnatural hyphenation, and clich√©s.
- **Depth:** The content goes beyond surface-level observations to provide deeper context and analysis, offering genuine value to the reader.

## 3. Image Prompt Generation

Finally, a descriptive prompt is created for an AI image generator to produce a high-quality, relevant image that visually encapsulates the post's central theme. The prompt is designed to be detailed and specific to ensure a sophisticated and on-brand visual output.
